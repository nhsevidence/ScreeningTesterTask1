# NICE Tester -- screening task

A system has been developed based on _User story #123_, which processes user inputs.

## User story #123

A system that is required which takes characters (a-d and A-D only) and an action to perform on the characters.

Actions are:

1. `+` To make a character in upper case if it is not already
2. `-` To make a character in lower case if it is not already

This is an example how the system should work:

User input: 
    
    -A,+a,--B,+c
    
System output: 
    
    aAbC

## Instructions

1. Create a table like the one below to describe the test data, your test intention and the results you expect from the system.

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Test Data</th>
        <th>Test Intention</th>
        <th>Expected Results</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>-A,+a,-B,+c</td>
        <td>To check if the system works</td>
        <td>aAbC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>...</td>
                <td></td>
                        <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
